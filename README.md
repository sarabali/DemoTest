# XPath Generator

XPath Generator is a work in progress tool, that will let you copy paste
XML document into a text box and then generate XPath based on the cursor
position in the document.

## TODO

* UI
* Path specific to that cursor location instead of a generic one
(/foo/bar[2]/baz) instead of (/foo/bar/baz)
* Move to gh-pages

## Issues

Please report issues and suggestions on Github
